**Superhero Application**

This is an application for creating, editing, and viewing superheros. A user can create a superhero with an alias, real name, superpower, and place of origin.

The front end is hosted at this link for [github pages](https://fmc127.github.io/marvel-client/)

The back end API is hosted at this link for [heroku](https://marvel-database.herokuapp.com/)

**Planning and Development**
1. User stories and ERD came first.
2. Generated scaffold for 'characters'.
3. Changed the controller to OpenRead

**User Stories:**
As a user I want to be able to sign up and login.
As a user I want to be able to change my password whenever I want.
As a user I want to be able to sign out so no one can access my account.
As a user I want to be able to create a superhero.
As a user I want to be able to update a superhero.
As a user I want to be able to delete a superhero.
As a user I want to be the only user to make changed to my superheros.
As a user I want to be able to view a list of my superheros.

The opening page will have the 'Superhero Log' title with the 'sign in' and 'sign up' buttons that will be aligned to the left.

Once the user is signed in, the 'change password', 'sign out', 'create a hero', 'update a hero' and 'show heros' button will appear.

Once the 'show heros' button is clicked, the 'clear heros' button will appear. Pressing the 'clear heros' button will remove the list and the 'show heros' button will appear again.

All messages for any buttons clicked will appear above the forms in the top left of the screen.

Once signed back out, the 'change password', 'sign out', 'create a hero', 'update a hero', and 'show heros' buttons will dissappear.


**Problem Solving Strategy**
- Check for errors in the console and the terminal. Follow the error codes if they exist.
- If there are no errors, follow the flow of data to check for issues.

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**
For the back end I would like to add a many-to-many relationship. The join table would be 'Teams'.


**Technologies Utilized**
Back-end:
Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Posgresql, Git, Heroku

Front-end:
JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Git.

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**
For the front end I would like to improve the CSS.
