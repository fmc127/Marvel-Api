**Superhero Application**

This is an application for creating, editing, and viewing superheros. A user can create a superhero with an alias, real name, superpower, and place of origin.

**Planning and Development**
1. User stories came first.
2. Generated scaffold for 'characters'.
3. Changed the controller to OpenRead

**Problem Solving Strategy**
- Check for errors in the console and the terminal. Follow the error codes if they exist.
- If there are no errors, follow the flow of data to check for issues.

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**
For the back end I would like to add a many-to-many relationship. The join table would be 'Teams'.


**Technologies Utilized**

Back-end:
Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Posgres

Front-end:
